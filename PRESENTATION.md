# 🌍 Company Location Discovery System
## AI-Powered Multi-Agent Business Intelligence Platform

---

## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

**Business analysts and market researchers spend countless hours manually searching for comprehensive company location data across fragmented sources, leading to incomplete datasets and missed market opportunities.**

---

## 📊 **Why This Problem Matters**

**For Market Researchers & Business Analysts:**
Market expansion, competitive analysis, and investment due diligence require accurate, comprehensive location data for target companies. Currently, analysts must manually search Google Maps, scrape company websites, parse SEC filings, and cross-reference multiple databases - a process that can take days per company and often results in incomplete or outdated information. This manual approach doesn't scale when analyzing hundreds of companies for market sizing, competitive mapping, or investment research.

**For Sales & Marketing Teams:**
Territory planning, lead qualification, and market penetration strategies depend on knowing where companies operate. Without comprehensive location data, sales teams miss opportunities, marketing campaigns target the wrong regions, and resource allocation becomes inefficient. The current fragmented approach to location discovery creates blind spots that directly impact revenue and market share.

---

## 🚀 **Proposed Solution**

**Our AI-powered multi-agent system transforms company location discovery from a manual, time-intensive process into an automated, comprehensive intelligence platform.** Users simply input a company name (or upload a CSV of hundreds of companies), and our system orchestrates multiple specialized AI agents that simultaneously search Google Maps, scrape company websites, analyze SEC filings, and cross-reference business databases to compile a complete location profile.

**The user experience is seamless and intuitive:** a clean web interface where users enter their API keys (ensuring data privacy and cost control), input company information, and watch real-time progress as our agents work in parallel. Within minutes, users receive professionally formatted reports in Excel, CSV, and JSON formats, complete with addresses, coordinates, confidence scores, and source attribution. The system handles everything from single company lookups to bulk processing of 100+ companies, making it perfect for both ad-hoc research and large-scale market analysis projects.

## 🤖 **Agentic Reasoning Implementation**

**We use agentic reasoning in three critical areas:**

1. **Intelligent Source Selection:** Our supervisor agent analyzes the company profile and dynamically decides which data sources to prioritize based on company size, industry, and public/private status.

2. **Adaptive Data Extraction:** Each specialist agent (Google Maps, Web Scraper, SEC Filer) uses reasoning to adapt its search strategies based on initial results - for example, if the web scraper finds multiple office pages, it reasons about which are likely to contain location data.

3. **Smart Deduplication & Validation:** The aggregator agent employs sophisticated reasoning to identify duplicate locations across sources, resolve address conflicts, and assess the reliability of conflicting information using contextual clues and source credibility.

---

## 📡 **Data Sources & External APIs**

### **Google Maps Places API**
Primary source for verified business locations with official addresses, phone numbers, and operating hours - provides highest confidence location data.

### **Company Websites (Web Scraping)**
Extracts location information from "About Us," "Contact," "Locations," and "Offices" pages using intelligent content parsing and semantic understanding.

### **SEC EDGAR Database**
Analyzes 10-K filings, 8-K reports, and other regulatory documents to identify subsidiary locations, international operations, and facility addresses for public companies.

### **Tavily Search API**
Performs targeted web searches for location-related news, press releases, and business directory listings to capture recent location changes and expansion announcements.

---

## 📝 **Data Processing Strategy**

### **Chunking Strategy: Semantic Location Blocks**
We use intelligent semantic chunking rather than fixed-size chunks, breaking content into location-relevant sections (e.g., "Office Locations," "Contact Information," "Store Finder" pages). This approach ensures that related location information stays together during processing, improving extraction accuracy and reducing context loss. Our chunking algorithm identifies location-specific markers (addresses, phone numbers, "office," "branch," "headquarters" keywords) and creates coherent blocks around these signals.

### **Specialized Data Requirements**
- **Address Standardization Database:** USPS and international postal standards for consistent address formatting
- **Geocoding Validation:** Coordinate verification to ensure address-coordinate alignment
- **Business Entity Resolution:** Company name variations and subsidiary mapping for accurate attribution
- **Historical Location Tracking:** Time-stamped location changes for trend analysis and data freshness scoring
